    "thinking": "Okay, I need to figure out the best search term for Twitter/X based on the user's input. The user wrote, \"Find me the latest news about AI developments.\" \n\nFirst, I'll break down the sentence. The main goal is to find the latest news, so \"latest news\" is a key part. But since the user is asking for a search term, I should focus on the most relevant keywords that would yield the best results on Twitter/X.\n\nThe subject here is AI developments. \"AI\" is a common abbreviation for Artificial Intelligence, and it's widely used in tech discussions. \"Developments\" refers to new advancements or updates in the field. \n\nI should consider which of these terms is more likely to be used in hashtags or discussions on Twitter/X. \"AI\" is a popular hashtag and a broad term that covers various aspects, including developments. \"Developments\" alone might be too vague and not specific enough to yield focused results.\n\nSo, combining \"AI\" with \"developments\" makes sense because it narrows down the search to the specific area the user is interested in. Using both terms together should provide more relevant and up-to-date information on Twitter/X.\n\nI should make sure not to include the word \"X\" in the response and keep it concise, using only 1-3 keywords. In this case, \"AI developments\" is a two-word phrase that accurately captures the user's request.\n\nTherefore, the optimal search term would be \"AI developments.\""

    "thinking": "Okay, so I need to analyze the sentiment of these two tweets. The first one says, \"I am really excited about the economy.\" That sounds positive. The word \"excited\" is a strong positive emotion. So, the sentiment here is definitely positive.\n\nThe second tweet is, \"I am bullish on cryptocurrency.\" \"Bullish\" is a term often used in finance to mean someone expects prices to rise, so that's also a positive sentiment. \n\nI should make sure I don't add any extra opinions, just state the facts based on the words used. Both tweets express positive feelings, one about the economy and the other about crypto. So the overall sentiment is positive in both cases.\n\nI need to present this clearly and concisely, pointing out the positive language in each tweet without any extra fluff.",
    "analysis": "The sentiment of both tweets is positive. The first tweet expresses excitement about the economy, indicating a favorable outlook. The second tweet uses \"bullish,\" a term suggesting confidence in cryptocurrency's growth, further indicating optimism. Both reflect positive sentiments towards their respective subjects."

above are the api endpoints responses :
and this is the hacakthon details
Masa Subnet 42, launched in August 2024, is our premiere real-time data layer for powering AI agents and applications. Real-time AI intelligence requires real-time data. Subnet 42 specializes in creating decentralized data pipelines and data storage (enterprise time series and vector store), providing an alternative to traditional centralized APIs.

Here is a fact sheet on SN42.

The Challenge:
Objective: Build an innovative MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin that can be featured in Masa's subnet 42. Your MCP plugin will deliver direct value by enhancing AI agent capabilities across the Bittensor ecosystem.

What is MCP
You can think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications and AI agents. Just as USB-C offers a standardized way to connect devices to various accessories, MCP standardizes how your AI apps connect to different data sources and tools. MCP ensures models evolve beyond static training data, improving relevance and accuracy by aligning outputs with situational needs.

Static AI often fails in dynamic environments, leading to biased, outdated, or irrelevant results. MCP addresses this by embedding contextual awareness, enabling personalization (e.g., tailoring medical advice to patient history) and adaptability (e.g., adjusting autonomous vehicle decisions during storms). It also enhances transparency, helping models ‚Äúexplain‚Äù context-driven choices for regulatory compliance.

Here is a great intro thread from @akshay_pachaar on MCP
